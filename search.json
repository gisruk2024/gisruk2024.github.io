    "text": "For over 30 years the annual GISRUK conference has showcased discrete research projects that contribute new theories, methods and insights to a very wide set of spatial analysis problems and application areas.\nA characteristic of most GISRUK submissions, even commentaries and perspective pieces (cf. Chris Brunsdon’s 2023 keynote on Bayes, Ulam and Missingness), is that they are underpinned by some new and interesting dataset and/or computational technique. Many GISRUK authors make a habit of publishing their code and data via open platforms (Figshare, Dataverse, Github, CRAN, pypi). The importance of this activity – open data and methods – is nowadays taken-for-granted in the GISRUK community. However, mechanisms for incentivising and formalising it are perhaps less well-established.\nWith this Special Issue, we invite GISRUK authors to document the code and/or data underpinning their work. We encourage submissions featured either at the latest 2024 conference or those appearing in the recent past and certainly submissions that extend and expand upon early work presented at GISRUK.\nEdited by Roger Beecham (School of Geography and Leeds Institute for Data Analytics, University of Leeds, r.j.beecham@leeds.ac.uk), Arjan Gosal, Nick Hood, Vikki Houlden, Will James, Rachel Oldroyd, Keiran Suchak (School of Geography, University of Leeds), Fran Pontin (Leeds Institute for Data Analytics and School of Geography, University of Leeds) and Jonny Huck (Department of Geography, University of Manchester)."

    "text": "Other Places…\nBeyond the main conference venues outlined above, we have also curated a short list of other places that visitors to Leeds may enjoy at the end of a conference day. These all lie around the city centre and can be seen on the map below.\n\nThe Bankers Cat: Located within 5 mins walk of the conference venue and around the corner from the train station, The Bankers Cat has a lovely selection of beers and an area with large tables in the basement vault for groups.\nTapped: Just across the road from the Bankers Cat, you will find Tapped which also serves a great selection of beers as well stone baked pizzas.\nNorth Taproom: If you are looking to sample some of the brilliant beers on offer from Leeds’ local breweries, then North Taproom is a good place to start. Run by North Brewing, this taproom serves a great selection of beers as well as street food from Little Bao Boy.\nThe Northern Market: Previously Assembly Underground (and Carpe Diem before that), The Northern Market is now a beer hall and food market run by another of Leeds’ local breweries - Northern Monk. If you are looking for a stop on your way up towards the conference dinner then this is a good one.\nWhitelock’s Ale House & The Turk’s Head: First opened in 1715, Whitelock’s stakes a claim to being Leeds’ oldest pub. Tucked away down an alley off of Briggate along with its sister pub - The Turk’s Head - Whitelock’s is a part of Leeds pub history and serves a selection of real ale and independent craft beers.\nBelow Stairs: If beer isn’t really your thing and you are looking for cocktails instead then Below Stairs is a hidden gem. Tucked away on South Parade, this cocktail bar boasts a unique menu worth checking out."

The focal point will be the exploration of night lights data in Global South contexts, utilizing the R and time-series analysis to understand the evolution of economic activity within a country. The workshop will exploit both aggregates and disaggregated (10m by 10m) nights light data. It will also cover the integration of open street map data to evaluate the goodness of fit between night lights and Points of Interest (POIs) as proxies for economic activity.\nOutcome:\nParticipants will leave the workshop with a deeper understanding of how GIS, night lights data, and time-series analysis can be harnessed for public good. They will be equipped with practical skills to analyse economic trends, evaluate spatial relationships, and contribute meaningfully to projects aimed at societal well-being.\nThis workshop will leverage the following R packages for an in-depth GIS analysis:\n\nR.utils;\ndplyr;\nsf;\nggplot2;\ntmap;\nviridis;\nRColorBrewer;\nraster;\nterra;\nexactextractr;\ntidyterra"

We hope that this won’t cause too many problems before the ECR workshops on 9th April. The good news is that LNER and Cross Country are not affected by strikes on Monday 8th April, but there may be some spillover disruption.\nWelcome. So hopefully the strikes won’t be too troublesome – and we very much looking forward to seeing you in Leeds! Keep an eye out on this page as we post further updates in the next few days. See also a curated a list of recommended places nearby for food / drink.\nWelcome to the 32nd Annual GIS Research UK Conference. The conference will be hosted at University of Leeds on 9th – 12th April 2024.\nGISRUK attracts international researchers and practitioners in GIS and related fields to share and discuss the latest advances in spatial computing and analysis. The work presented at GISRUK covers a range of methodological approaches and application areas, including: geographic data science, geocomputation, applied statistics, geography, health, urban and transport planning, crime science.\nWe welcome papers covering all aspects of GIS, both methodological and applied. There is also a theme for the 2024 conference – GIS for public good: data, theory, policy – around which keynotes and other activity will be structured.\nSee the Call for papers for details on how to submit.\nNew. We have agreed a Special Issue linked to the conference with Environment & Planning B: Urban Data/Code. Details can be found here. We encourage discrete Data/Code products that relate to the conference theme: GIS for public good: data, theory, policy.
