    "text": "For over 30 years the annual GISRUK conference has showcased discrete research projects that contribute new theories, methods and insights to a very wide set of spatial analysis problems and application areas.\nA characteristic of most GISRUK submissions, even commentaries and perspective pieces (cf. Chris Brunsdon’s 2023 keynote on Bayes, Ulam and Missingness), is that they are underpinned by some new and interesting dataset and/or computational technique. Many GISRUK authors make a habit of publishing their code and data via open platforms (Figshare, Dataverse, Github, CRAN, pypi). The importance of this activity – open data and methods – is nowadays taken-for-granted in the GISRUK community. However, mechanisms for incentivising and formalising it are perhaps less well-established.\nWith this Special Issue, we invite GISRUK authors to document the code and/or data underpinning their work. We encourage submissions featured either at the latest 2024 conference or those appearing in the recent past and certainly submissions that extend and expand upon early work presented at GISRUK.\nEdited by Roger Beecham (School of Geography and Leeds Institute for Data Analytics, University of Leeds, r.j.beecham@leeds.ac.uk), Arjan Gosal, Nick Hood, Vikki Houlden, Will James, Rachel Oldroyd, Keiran Suchak (School of Geography, University of Leeds), Fran Pontin (Leeds Institute for Data Analytics and School of Geography, University of Leeds) and Jonny Huck (Department of Geography, University of Manchester)."

The focal point will be the exploration of night lights data in Global South contexts, utilizing the R and time-series analysis to understand the evolution of economic activity within a country. The workshop will exploit both aggregates and disaggregated (10m by 10m) nights light data. It will also cover the integration of open street map data to evaluate the goodness of fit between night lights and Points of Interest (POIs) as proxies for economic activity.\nOutcome:\nParticipants will leave the workshop with a deeper understanding of how GIS, night lights data, and time-series analysis can be harnessed for public good. They will be equipped with practical skills to analyse economic trends, evaluate spatial relationships, and contribute meaningfully to projects aimed at societal well-being.\nThis workshop will leverage the following R packages for an in-depth GIS analysis:\n\nR.utils;\ndplyr;\nsf;\nggplot2;\ntmap;\nviridis;\nRColorBrewer;\nraster;\nterra;\nexactextractr;\ntidyterra"

Her expertise is in advanced applications of GIS, with focus on spatial demography to support decision-making processes, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, producing high resolution, open and contemporary data, mainly on projects related to reproductive, maternal, newborn, child, and adolescence health. She also leads the development of sophisticated analytical tools and provides capacity-building aimed at empowering local stakeholders to utilize spatial data effectively in their decision-making processes, facilitating knowledge transfer and fostering enduring partnerships with international stakeholders. Her experience includes collaborations with governments, academic and non-academic institutions, and NGOs around the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMichelle Morris is an interdisciplinary researcher with a background spanning: health informatics, geography, nutritional epidemiology and health economics. Michelle leads the Nutrition and Lifestyle Analytics team at Leeds, focused on the use of new forms of ‘big’ and spatial data in health research, working closely with industry partners on food and activity data. Her research focuses on how new and emerging forms of data and data science methods can be best utilised to understand diet and lifestyle and their impacts on population health and planetary health. Michelle is a Fellow of the Alan Turing Institute and the Academic Chair for the LIDA Data Science Development Programme which champions data science for public good and leads on improving Equality, diversity and inclusion in the data science workforce.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevi John Wolf is Associate Professor in Spatial Analysis at the University of Bristol’s Quantitative Spatial Science Lab. He works in spatial data science, building new methods and software to learn new things about social and environmental processes. The techniques developed are used across urban planning, political science, economics, public health, astronomy, and genomics to understand things like commuting, infill development, deprivation, voting, redistricing, industrial clusters, disease transmission, and anomaly detection in images. Levi is a core maintainer of geopandas, author of CenPy and co-maintainer of PySAL. He has recently written Geographic Data Science with Python, with Dani Arribas-Bel and Sergio Rey. He has industry experience at Nextdoor, CARTO and Mondial Relay."
