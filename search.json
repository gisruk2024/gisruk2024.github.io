The deadline is Monday 8th January 2024 Friday 19th January 2024 and submission is via Oxford Abstracts (submission link).\nWork presented at GISRUK covers a range of methodological approaches and application areas. We are particularly interested in papers that align with the conference theme – GIS for public good: data, theory, policy – but below is a non-exhaustive list of typical focuses:\nData/Methods\n\nSpatial statistics\nAgent-based models\nOpen data and code\nReproducibility and inference\nUncertainty quantification and analysis\nMachine learning and AI\nData visualization and communication\n\nApplication areas\n\nTransportation and land use\nEnvironment and sustainability\nHealth, neighbourhoods and housing\nCrime analysis\nLabour markets and economic geography\n\nSubmitted abstracts will be assessed by at least two members from the GISRUK 2024 Scientific Committee.\nNew. We have agreed a Special Issue linked to the conference with Environment & Planning B: Urban Data/Code. Details to follow, but we will be encouraging discrete Data/Code products that relate to the conference theme: GIS for public good: data, theory, policy. For information on the Urban Data/Code section of E&P B, see Arribas-Bel et al.’s (2021) editorial.\n\nGuidelines\n\nSubmission is via Oxford Abstracts submission link.\nSubmissions should be extended abstracts of no more than 1500 words.\nAbstracts must be prepared using one of these templates (MS Word, LaTeX, Quarto).\nNew: Identify whether you would like your submission to be considered for the GISRUK & OSGeo:UK GoFundGeo Award.\nAuthors should make efforts towards enabling reproducibility of their work, where possible. GISRUK do not produce specific guidance, but authors may wish to consult relevant documentation from organisations such as AGILE.\nAny queries can be directed to : info@gisruk.org.\n\n\n\nKey dates\n\nPaper submission deadline: Monday 8th January 2024 Friday 19th January 2024\nPaper review notifications: Monday 12th February 2024 Monday 19th February 2024"

    "text": "For over 30 years the annual GISRUK conference has showcased discrete research projects that contribute new theories, methods and insights to a very wide set of spatial analysis problems and application areas.\nA characteristic of most GISRUK submissions, even commentaries and perspective pieces (cf. Chris Brunsdon’s 2023 keynote on Bayes, Ulam and Missingness), is that they are underpinned by some new and interesting dataset and/or computational technique. Many GISRUK authors make a habit of publishing their code and data via open platforms (Figshare, Dataverse, Github, CRAN, pypi). The importance of this activity – open data and methods – is nowadays taken-for-granted in the GISRUK community. However, mechanisms for incentivising and formalising it are perhaps less well-established.\nWith this Special Issue, we invite GISRUK authors to document the code and/or data underpinning their work. We encourage submissions featured either at the latest 2024 conference or those appearing in the recent past and certainly submissions that extend and expand upon early work presented at GISRUK.\nEdited by Roger Beecham (School of Geography and Leeds Institute for Data Analytics, University of Leeds, r.j.beecham@leeds.ac.uk), Arjan Gosal, Nick Hood, Vikki Houlden, Will James, Rachel Oldroyd, Keiran Suchak (School of Geography, University of Leeds), Fran Pontin (Leeds Institute for Data Analytics and School of Geography, University of Leeds) and Jonny Huck (Department of Geography, University of Manchester)."
