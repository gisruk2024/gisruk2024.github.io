The conference will be hosted at University of Leeds on 9th – 12th April 2024.\nGISRUK attracts international researchers and practitioners in GIS and related fields to share and discuss the latest advances in spatial computing and analysis. The work presented at GISRUK covers a range of methodological approaches and application areas, including: geographic data science, geocomputation, applied statistics, geography, health, urban and transport planning, crime science.\nWe welcome papers covering all aspects of GIS, both methodological and applied. There is also a theme for the 2024 conference – GIS for public good: data, theory, policy – around which keynotes and other activity will be structured.\nSee the Call for papers for details on how to submit.\nNew. We have agreed a Special Issue linked to the conference with Environment & Planning B: Urban Data/Code. Details can be found here. We encourage discrete Data/Code products that relate to the conference theme: GIS for public good: data, theory, policy.

    "text": "For over 30 years the annual GISRUK conference has showcased discrete research projects that contribute new theories, methods and insights to a very wide set of spatial analysis problems and application areas.\nA characteristic of most GISRUK submissions, even commentaries and perspective pieces (cf. Chris Brunsdon’s 2023 keynote on Bayes, Ulam and Missingness), is that they are underpinned by some new and interesting dataset and/or computational technique. Many GISRUK authors make a habit of publishing their code and data via open platforms (Figshare, Dataverse, Github, CRAN, pypi). The importance of this activity – open data and methods – is nowadays taken-for-granted in the GISRUK community. However, mechanisms for incentivising and formalising it are perhaps less well-established.\nWith this Special Issue, we invite GISRUK authors to document the code and/or data underpinning their work. We encourage submissions featured either at the latest 2024 conference or those appearing in the recent past and certainly submissions that extend and expand upon early work presented at GISRUK.\nEdited by Roger Beecham (School of Geography and Leeds Institute for Data Analytics, University of Leeds, r.j.beecham@leeds.ac.uk), Arjan Gosal, Nick Hood, Vikki Houlden, Will James, Rachel Oldroyd, Keiran Suchak (School of Geography, University of Leeds), Fran Pontin (Leeds Institute for Data Analytics and School of Geography, University of Leeds) and Jonny Huck (Department of Geography, University of Manchester)."

    "text": "GISRUK and OSGeo:UK are co-funding a GoFundGeo grant of £500 that will be offered to one GISRUK presenter who presents a tool or technique that has potential for wide uptake in the open source geospatial (OSGeo) community. The purpose of the grant is to help the recipient to make their approach easily adoptable through the provision of open source code repository and/or tool (e.g. a QGIS plugin). This grant is open to all, but with a focus on ECRs.\nThis is the first time that this grant has been awarded, but we envisage that likely candidates will be GISRUK presenters (oral or poster) who have either developed some code (e.g., a Python/R script or library, a plugin for QGIS or some standalone software etc.); or a method / technique that has the clear potential to be turned into some code. In either case, we are looking for a submission with the potential to be used widely in the open source geospatial community in the UK and globally."

We will support you with this process. If you wish to progress to a full OSGeo Project and undertake the incubation process you can, but this is not required.\nSubmit a talk to the next FOSS4G:UK conference to present the software / library you have developed. You are also welcome to apply to present at FOSS4G, the international conference series.\nProvide an update of your progress / outputs (approx 1 year after the funding). e.g., a presentation at GISRUK or a GISRUK webinar.\n\nWe will support you with this and help you with the process of applying to be an OSGeo Community Project and submit a Talk to FOSS4G:UK."
